I'm the lead developer of PsXTRA (completely remade as a simple and modern (Win8 Metro-ish) website), UnityExplorer+ (started getting popular) and other projects (some are dead forks).

I'm also learning Lua and C#. (I'm kinda bad at C#)

### UnityExplorer+ series <br/>
UnityExplorer Plus: Released (v1.2)<br/>
UnityExplorer Plus Rewritten: Canceled (v2.0.0-alpha.2)

### PsXTRA (formerly PsExtra) series <br/>
PsExtra (OG): Shut down, succeeded by PsXTRA (v1.0?)<br/>
PsExtra Desktop: Canceled (v1.0 Alpha)<br/>
PsXTRA Ultimate: Active, in development (v0.1.5, 0.2 coming soon)<br/>
PsXTRA: Active, in development (v2.1.0-beta.4)

### Other projects (some of these do not have version information) <br/>
Super Expert 2.2074 port (Geode mod, my old fork): Discontinued, replaced with new fork<br/>
LOLKitteh (PsXTRA sister project): Currently being reworked (v2.0)<br/>
StarrieOS (Fork of a operating system called ReactOS): Canceled, rework planned (SRE30B*) (BRA40 was being worked on) (B is Balloon World)<br/>
Ice Cream Sandwich (PenguinMod extensions repo, successor of Remix): Released<br/>
Shaldi's Tower of Chaos Pack (Baldi's Basics Plus mod): Canceled due to being rushed (Snapshot #1, snapshot #2 was in development)<br/>
platformer.mp4 (Platformer game, where you play as Epsilon, the 5th letter of the Greek alphabet): Coming soon<br/>
数学 (Also known as Sugaku. Desmos clone that has desktop support): In development<br/>
The Lost Files (A lost media archive, where its webpage contents is a mix between a spreadsheet and a HTML document): Under construction<br/>
Frebble (A joke game where you have to hover over bubbles to pop them in a time span of 10 seconds. If you lose, you get jumpscared by Freddy Fazbear from the Five Nights at Freddy's series (credits to Scott Cawthon)): Coming soon<br/>
A number sign's day (A game about a number sign, and the player is in the number sign's house. There is no main goal, the player can just relax, wander around the house, or go outside to enjoy some fresh air.): Coming soon<br/>
Sticky's Monstrosity (A modpack for Baldi's Basics Plus containing hundreds of mods (likely around 140+), intended for BB+ 0.14 (coming soon). It is inspired by the "Mystic's Monstrosity" Minecraft modpack, made by Mysticpasta1, that adds nearly 2000 mods to that game. This modpack also comes with its own content, such as posters, new hall textures and much more, alongside having a base plugin for the modpack): Coming soon (will have a LOT of demo builds before public release)

### More info on Sticky's Monstrosity <br/>
The modpack will require BB+ 0.14, at least 16 gigabytes of RAM (8 during demos 1-5, will require 16 in demos 6 and beyond) and 3 gigabytes of storage (1.5 to 2 during demos, may vary depending on your hard drive). This modpack may also get updated to future versions of BB+, albeit with less mods (around the 80-110 mod range), due to their respective mods not yet being ported. Also, before you play the modpack, you must have the seed input unlocked first (unlocked by beating hide-and-seek in vanilla), as there is some stupid bug with the any symbols in seeds mod, where the game would fail to set the seed when its input was not unlocked yet, resulting in the seed being set to 0 on every run.
